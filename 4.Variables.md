```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

  

int main(){

    printf("There was a man names george\n");

    printf("He was 70 years old\n");

    printf("He really liked the name george\n");

    printf("But he did not like being 70\n");

  

    return 0;

  

}
```

Variables are basically containers used to hold data of different types. In the code above we have simple program to tell a short story, Say we want to edit the values of the name and the age.
We'd have to manually change the name and age. But we may not have that luxury when working on a large codebase with different values
Hence the use of variables.

Now in the code code below we created a variable for the datatype of a string
A string is a collection of characters so we will initialize using
`char characterName[] = "john" `

Similary when initalizing a character we use

`char Charactername = "X"`

The difference is the square brackets, they seperate a string from a char

for numerical data we use the datatype of an integer or `int`
`in characterAge = 50`


```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

  

int main(){

    char characterName[] = "John";

    int characterAge = 50;

  
  
  

    printf("There was a man names %s\n", characterName);

    printf("He was %d years old\n", characterAge);

    printf("He really liked the name %s\n", characterName);

    printf("But he did not like being %d\n", characterAge);

  

    return 0;

  

}
```

But the values still wont be changed thats why we have format specifiers. The are added when we are trying to display data about certain variables

```
    printf("There was a man names %s\n", characterName);
    printf("He was %d years old\n", characterAge);
```

The format specifier for integers is %d and the format specifier for strings is %s
We then follow up using a comma and the variable name specified outside of the colon block.

we can alter the variable of age by inputting a variable of 30 half way through the program and this will change the output.
