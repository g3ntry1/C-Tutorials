Arrays can store multiple values or characters or multiple pieces of information

```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

  

int main(){

    int luckynum[] = {4,26,75,23,78,1,9};

    printf("%d", luckynum[0]);

    return 0;

}
```

Now in the above code we created an array of integers made up of 6 elements, 
to print out any element in the list we use the index starting from zero of that array to reference and print it out.
## Modifying an array

by referring to the index of the object in the array we can edit it by changing the vale of the selected index.

```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

  

int main(){

    int luckynum[] = {4,26,75,23,78,1,9};

  

    luckynum[2] = 55;

    printf("%d", luckynum[0]);//outputs 55 in place of 72

    return 0;

}
```

We can also create and empty array by not putting anything values between the curly braces after the equal sign.
