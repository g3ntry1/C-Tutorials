to create this we need a 2 variables the secret number and the guess number along with while loop which has the conditions that unless the secret number is number is not reached the program run indefinitely 
```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

#include <string.h> //remember to add string.h when starting out code

  

int main(){

    int secretNum = 5;

  

    int guess;

    while(guess != secretNum){

        printf("Enter a number: ");

        scanf("%d", &guess);

  

    }

    printf("Hey you win!!!")

    return 0;

}
```

We can add more functionality to it by implementing a limit to how many times a user can enter a number and also we can create a function to give an output whether the user wins or he runs out of guesses for the game.
