A constant is a value that cannot be changed 

```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

  

int main(){

    int num = 5;

  

    printf("%d \n", num);

  

    num =8;

  

    printf("%d",num);

  
  

    return 0;

  

}
```

In the code above we created a variable num printed it out, then half wy we changed the value of num

```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

  

int main(){

    const int num = 5;

  

    printf("%d \n", num);

  
  

    return 0;

  

}
```

We use the const identifier infront of the datatype so as to fix it in place and ensure it is nt changed anywhere in the code

An error will be thrown if we try to modify code anywhere with a constant
