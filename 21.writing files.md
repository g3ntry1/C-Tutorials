when writing files we have 3 modes 
r read
w write
a append

first we will use a variable type similar to int called `FILE`, then we use a pointer and create a pointer variable `fpointer`  
the using the fopen() tag we create a name for the file and select a file mode to use it on
in the case below we used write to create a file 
now to input information.
we use the fprintf( ) which is similar to the printf but for files 
we then specify the pointer variable for the file we opened then the input values

to round it off and close the file after we written to it we use fclose and the ointer variable name
```
int main(){

  

    FILE * fpointer = fopen("nice.txt","w" );

  
  

    fprintf(fpointer, "Joan, salesman\npam, reception\nsam, operations");

  

    fclose(fpointer);

    return 0;

}
```

to then append into the file we use the a tag instead of the w
```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

#include <strings.h>

  
  

int main(){

  

    FILE * fpointer = fopen("nice.txt","a" );

  

    fprintf(fpointer, "\nkelly, cleaning");

  

    fprintf(fpointer, "Joan, salesman\npam, reception\nsam, operations");

  

    fclose(fpointer);

    return 0;

}
```
It will then add the extra line within the fprintf tag.

## reading a file
 first well create a string variable called line and leave it empty and set the size to 255
then using our fpointer varibale and setting it to r.

we use the fgets command. we use line as the location where the output values should be stored, set the same size as the string size and reference the pointer variable

the with the printf function we output the resultts

```
int main(){

  

    char line[255];

    FILE * fpointer = fopen("nice.txt","r" );

  

    fgets(line, 255, fpointer);

    printf("%s", line);

  

    fclose(fpointer);

    return 0;

}
```

it will give us the first line of the nice file to continuosly orint other lines we must continue to repeat the fgets line to go for line 2 and 3
