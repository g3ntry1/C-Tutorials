A mad libs game is one in which a story is given and random words are inserted at certain points to make it seem funny now here's what i did.
I made a madlibs game using jujutsu kaisen charaters

```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

  

int main(){

  

    char color[20];

    char cursedspirits[30];

    char jjkvillain[30];

  

    printf("enter a color: ");

    scanf("%s", color);

    printf("enter a cursed-spirit: ");

    scanf("%s", cursedspirits);

    printf("enter a villain from jjk that is not a cursed spirit: ");

    scanf("%s", jjkvillain);

  
  
  

    printf("roses are %s\n", color);

    printf("%s fashioned against me wont prosper\n",cursedspirits);

    printf("With this sacred treasure i summon\n");

    printf("big %s the opp stomper\n", jjkvillain);

  

    return 0;

}
```

initialized strings variable and gave them strong lengths called color cursed spirit an jjkvillain

created prompts for each of them
and referenced the printed outputs to them.
remeber you can use the fgets statement to ensure that all characters that extend beyond a single space are taken in.
