The main function is a function that runs once the program is executed.
Now note C is a compiled language so the arrangement of functions and their format of precedence matters. what i mean is that C reads line by line before compilation.
If you call an external function that is written after the main function from within the main function it will return an error, due to a deprecated method of calling a function

therefore calling a function to say hi must look like this

```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

  

void sayhi(){

    printf("hello user");

}

  
  

int main(){

    sayhi();

    return 0;

}
```

And not like this

```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

  

int main(){

    sayhi();

    return 0;

}

  

void sayhi(){

    printf("hello user");

}
```

## Parameters
A parameter is a value thats assign to a function to make it work a certain way.
for example we want to create a function that reads a single name and say hello when the function is called in the main function

```
#include <stdio.h>

#include <stdlib.h>

  

void sayhi(char name[]){

    printf("hello there %s ", name);

}

  
  
  

int main(){

  

    sayhi("Mike");

    return 0;

}
```
