Lesson 1 The Structure of a C program

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(){
	printf("Hello World");
	return 0;
	
}
```

Now explaining each line 

'#include' this is use to reference or add external functions and libraries to the code we are writting. In this case we are adding the "stdio.h" and the "stdlib.h" librabries to the code, that is we are importing the standard input output library and the standard library function 

int main is the main function under which all other functions and smaller code is written it is a method and within the main method everything is run.

printf is basically printing out the information within curly braces.

return 0 this line ensures that during runtime the output is 0 which means successfully ran with no errors if it returns 1 it means that there are errors within the code

Now to be able to execute a C program we have to build it using the compiler we installed

```
gcc hello.c -o hello
```

gcc the gnu compiler, using the file name and we use -o to set the output executables name being hello

```
.\hello
```

This line is used in the terminal to run the C file and get an output.
